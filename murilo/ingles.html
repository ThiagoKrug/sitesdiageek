    <h2>About Jax:</h2>
    <p>Jax debuted in Mortal Kombat II. He is presented as an archetypal African-American hero. In the chain of command of the Special Forces, he is Sonya Blade's direct superior and the force that tempers Sonya's impulsiveness. Jax is clear, cautious, and always watches over what his team does. When the need arises, he becomes a beast on the battlefield with the attitude and ferocity of a lion. He unscrupulously uses the most advanced technology available to enhance both himself and his unit. He was responsible for disfiguring the criminal Kano, forcing him to wear a metal plate over part of his face.<br><br>
        <br>In the alternate timeline, Jax died at the hands of Sindel and was resurrected as a revenant by Quan Chi, whom he was forced to serve. Although he was eventually freed and brought back to life, his experiences as a revenant left him traumatized, reducing the fierce warrior to a broken shadow of his former self. Later, he married a woman named Vera, with whom he had a daughter, Jacqui. Jax opposed the idea of her joining the Special Forces, as he did not want her to experience the same horrors and traumas he had. In Mortal Kombat 11, it is revealed that his wife had died, further breaking Jax and leading him to become a recluse. This gave Kronika the opportunity to recruit him for her goal of restoring the timeline, promising him the ability to prevent Jacqui from joining the Special Forces. Although he initially worked alongside Kronika, he was convinced to return to the side of good by his past self, his daughter, and Raiden, turning against his ally and joining the fight against her.<br>
        <br>In the New Era, Jax starts as an FBI agent who co-founded the Outer World Investigation Agency alongside ex-Yakuza Kenshi Takahashi after helping him fight gangsters on the same night Kenshi first met Shang Tsung.<br>
        <h2>Abilities:</h2>
        <p> Jax is a skilled and strong soldier, known for his incredible physical strength. He can crush human skulls with extreme ease and cause ground tremors with a single punch. His strength is enough to create purple shockwaves and launch them at enemies. Since Mortal Kombat 3, Jax has used cybernetic enhancements that further increase his strength, including portable missiles, energy boosters, nanokinetic metal morphing, and a piston mechanism to amplify the power of his punches.<br>
    <br>In later games, these cybernetics received new upgrades, such as rocket-propelled punches and plasma projectile launches. Jax also incorporates modern weaponry into his combat style, such as machine guns, grenades, rocket launchers, and RPGs, alongside his hand-to-hand combat skills. In Mortal Kombat 11, his cybernetic arms can heat up with each punch, increasing damage and allowing the launch of projectiles.<br>    
    <br>Besides his combat skills, Jax is a competent technician, scientist, and engineer. He was responsible for developing the portal technology used by the Outworld Investigation Agency and the SF's cybernetic enhancement program, as well as restoring Cyrax's free will after his defection from the Lin Kuei.</p>

        <h2>Calculate Jax's Punch Force!</h2>
<p>Use the formula <strong>F = m × a</strong> to calculate the force of Jax's punches!<br>
Just enter the mass of the object (in kg) and the acceleration (in m/s²) of the punch.</p>

<label for="mass">Object mass (kg):</label><br>
<input type="number" id="mass" placeholder="E.g.: 50"><br><br>

<label for="acceleration">Punch acceleration (m/s²):</label><br>
<input type="number" id="acceleration" placeholder="E.g.: 10"><br><br>

<button onclick="calculateForce()">Calculate Force</button>

<p id="result"></p>

<script>
    function calculateForce() {
        let mass = document.getElementById("mass").value;
        let acceleration = document.getElementById("acceleration").value;
        let force = mass * acceleration;

        document.getElementById("result").innerText = 
            "The force of Jax's punch is: " + force + " N";
    }
