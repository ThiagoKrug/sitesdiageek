            <h2> KaratÃª Shotokan </h2>

            <p class="lore"> 
    
                Shotokan is one of the styles of karate that emerged from the teachings
                given by sensei Gichin Funakoshi and his son, Yoshitaka Funakoshi
                The Shotokan style is characterized by strong bases and strikes to the entire body.
                The low-heel turns give fluidity to the movement
                and every movement begins with a defense.
                In this style, defensive movements are also offensive movements.
                For example, if an opponent wants to punch you,
                your movement should seek to injure his arm or hand with the hard parts of your own arm..</p>
            

            <h2> Kung Fu </h2>

            <p class="lore"> Kung Fu has Chinese origins and is recognized as both a combat
                sport and a martial art. Covers kicking, punching, twisting and hand-to-hand fighting 
                techniques. These techniques can be performed free-handed or using weapons.
                initially practiced for various purposes, such as self-defense,
                martial arts, healthy lifestyle habit or entertainment, becoming popular.
                The combination of philosophies, which included the appreciation of moral principles,
                gave rise to a wide variety of kung fu styles,
                such as Xingyiquan, Baguazhang and Taijiquan.</p>
