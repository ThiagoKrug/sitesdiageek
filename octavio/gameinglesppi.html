        <h2> What is Free Software? </h2>
        <p> Free Software refers to computer programs that give their users, by explicit decision of their programmers and designers, access to the source code or original programming code in which they were created, so that they can copy, modify, personalize, and distribute them freely. This results in several versions of the same program, whose appearance does not represent a legal or ethical violation of the original program.</p>
        <p>The term Free Software is attributed to the American Richard Stallman, who was the founder of the Free Software Foundation, where a significant number of computing specialists aspired to develop a completely free operating system, which they called the GNU Project (to distinguish it from Unix).</p>
