        <h1>About Liu Kang</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Liu Kang</strong> is also one of the most popular characters in the series, one of the best warriors on Earth and has defeated many to prove his worth.
            Throughout the series, Liu Kang was progressively portrayed as the main hero, becoming champion after the <span> Mortal Kombat tournament.</span>
            The single character who could be considered the closest rival to Liu Kang is Shang Tsung, who was defeated several times in battle by the Shaolin monk.
            Because of this, Kang is often considered the greatest threat to the plans of Tsung and his emperor, Shao Kahn. He is a member of the White Lotus Society. 
            <strong>Kang was killed by Tsung and Quan Chi's</strong> Deadly Alliance in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.

    <h1> Trivia </h1>

    <p>
       <br> Liu Kang was originally going to be called Yoshitsune Minamoto, named after a historical samurai, but John Tobias stated that they could not deal with the name.<br>

       <br> Although "Liu" (劉), a common Chinese surname, is generally treated as Liu Kang's family name as seen in various localizations in Asia per his localized name "劉鋼" or "劉康", his surname is officially "Kang" in Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition, the SNES manual of Mortal Kombat, and the 1995 film.
        This is further reinforced by the introduction of his ancestor, Cheh Kang, in a Mirror Match intro in MK11.<br>

        <br> According to his personal information in Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang's father is Lee Kang and his mother is Lin Kang.
        He also has a younger brother, Chow Kang.<br>

        <br>Liu Kang has been in all the main games, but not all the spin-offs.
        The only main game that did not feature him as a playable character was Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. <br>

        <br> Liu Kang is one of the few characters in the series to be listed as multiple species: Human, Undead, Revenant, and God.   
        He bonds with Sub-Zero, who at different points was a Human, a Revenant, a Cyborg, and, in his MKA ending, a God to the most depicted species. <br>
